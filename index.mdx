This guide will make setting up Kyvic Shield a breeze.

Modern bots are smart, but they lack true consciousness and the nuanced logic of the human brain. Kyvic Shield leverages this fundamental gap. Our neuro-based captchas are designed to be effortlessly solved by your human visitors while presenting an insurmountable logical barrier to automated systems. Think of it as a friendly handshake for humans and an unbreachable wall for bots.

## Platform Compatibility

Kyvic is designed to be a universal layer of protection, but its CNAME-based method requires that you have full control over your domain's DNS settings. Please review this table to see if your website is compatible.

| Platform / Website Type                                 | Supported? | Reason / Notes                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Hosted Websites** (WordPress, Joomla, etc.)      | ✅ **Yes**  | You have full DNS control to point your CNAME record to Kyvic.                                            |
| **Cloud Hosting** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)            | ✅ **Yes**  | Perfect for custom applications where you manage the infrastructure.                                      |
| **VPS & Dedicated Servers** (DigitalOcean, Vultr)       | ✅ **Yes**  | Ideal use case. You have complete control over your domain and server.                                    |
| **Developer Platforms** (Vercel, Netlify, Render)       | ✅ **Yes**  | These platforms provide the necessary custom domain controls.                                             |

| **Managed E-commerce Platforms** (Shopify, BigCommerce) | ❌ **No**   | These platforms require your domain to point exclusively to their servers, creating a DNS conflict.       |
| **Managed Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace)         | ❌ **No**   | These are closed ecosystems that do not allow for this type of external proxying.                         |
| **DRM-Protected Video/Media** (e.g., Netflix clones)    | ❌ **No**   | Our proxy interferes with the secure Digital Rights Management (DRM) path required for protected content. |
| **Specialized Course Platforms** (Kajabi, Teachable)    | ❌ **No**   | These are managed platforms with similar restrictions to Wix and Shopify.                                 |

> **A Note on Future Support:** We are actively exploring partnerships with major managed platforms to offer seamless, one-click integrations in the future. Stay tuned for announcements\!

| **Enterprise-Grade DDoS Protection** | Your site stays online, even during a large-scale attack.    | Our network automatically detects and absorbs malicious traffic floods before they ever reach your server.  |
| **Origin IP Masking**                | Prevents attackers from targeting your server directly.      | Your server's true IP address is hidden behind our network, making it an invisible target.                  |
| **Global Edge Network**              | Fast load times for your visitors, wherever they are.        | Your captcha and security checks are served from a data center near your visitor, ensuring minimal latency. |
| **Automatic SSL/TLS**                | Your site is secured with HTTPS, building visitor trust.     | We provision and renew a free SSL certificate for your custom domain automatically.                         |

## Getting Started: Your 3-Step Setup

Follow these steps to protect your compatible website. The entire process typically takes less than 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Add Your Domain to Kyvic

In your Kyvic dashboard, add the domain or subdomain you want to protect (e.g., `www.your-awesome-site.com`). Our system will then provide you with the necessary DNS records for the next step.

### Step 2: Configure Your DNS

This is the most important step. You'll be pointing your domain's traffic to the Kyvic Shield network. Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap) to make these changes.

#### **Option A: For Subdomains (Recommended)**

This is the most common setup, used for domains like `www.your-awesome-site.com`.

1. Find the DNS record for your subdomain (e.g., `www`).
2. Change its type to `CNAME`.
3. Set the value (or "target") to: `shield.kyvic.com`
4. **Important:** If you're using a service like Cloudflare for your DNS, make sure the proxy status is set to **"DNS Only"** (grey cloud). This ensures the best performance.

#### **Option B: For Apex/Root Domains**

This applies if you want to protect your bare domain (e.g., `your-awesome-site.com`).

- **If your provider supports CNAME Flattening:** Some providers, like Cloudflare, allow you to set a `CNAME` record on your root domain. If so, follow the same steps as Option A for your root (`@`) record.
- **If your provider does NOT support CNAME Flattening:** This is very common. The industry-standard solution is to set up a simple redirect.
  1. Set up Kyvic for your `www` subdomain as described in **Option A**.
  2. Create a rule in your registrar to **redirect** all traffic from the root domain (`your-awesome-site.com`) to your protected subdomain (`https://www.your-awesome-site.com`).

### Step 3: Activate Your SSL Certificate

To keep your site secure with HTTPS, we need to verify your domain ownership.

1. In your Kyvic dashboard, you'll see one or two `TXT`**records**  with names like `_acme-challenge`.
2. Copy these records and add them to your DNS provider. This is a one-time verification step.
3. Once added, our system will automatically detect them and issue a free SSL certificate for your domain. This can take a few minutes to complete.

**That's it\! Your site is now protected by Kyvic Shield.**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Will Kyvic slow down my website?

No. Our security checks run on a highly optimized global edge network. For most users, the difference in latency is negligible and often imperceptible. We strongly recommend using the "DNS Only" setting for your CNAME record to ensure the fastest possible connection.

How do I know if Kyvic is working?

The easiest way is to try and access your site from a new private Browse window; you may be presented with a challenge. Over time, you should also notice a significant drop in spam comments, junk form submissions, and suspicious traffic in your server logs.

What happens if my own server goes down?

Kyvic Shield protects your site, but it can't serve your content if your origin server is offline. Visitors will see our captcha challenge, but after solving it, they will receive an error message since we cannot connect to your server.

Can I customize the look of the captcha page?

Currently, we offer a standard, clean interface designed for clarity and speed. We are planning to introduce customization options for our business customers in the future.

## Advanced Guides & Edge Cases

Most users won't need this section, but it's here for more complex setups.

### Using Kyvic with an Existing WAF (e.g., AWS WAF)

If you use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on your origin server, you must whitelist our network IPs to prevent your WAF from blocking legitimate traffic.

1. **Get Cloudflare's IPs:** The Kyvic network runs on Cloudflare. Get the official IP list from [cloudflare.com/ips](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).
2. **Create an IP Set:** In your WAF provider's dashboard (like AWS WAF), create an "IP Set" containing all of Cloudflare's IP ranges.
3. **Create an "Allow" Rule:** Add a rule to your WAF that **allows** any traffic coming from the Cloudflare IP Set. This rule should have the highest priority (e.g., run first).

### Protecting Sites with Multiple Subdomains

If your website loads assets (like images or scripts) from different subdomains (e.g., `www.yoursite.com` and `assets.yoursite.com`), you must add **each subdomain** to your Kyvic dashboard and configure a separate `CNAME` record for each one.
