Modern bots are smart, but they lack the true consciousness and nuanced logic of the human brain. Kyvic Aegis leverages this fundamental gap. Our neuro-based illusions are designed to be effortlessly solved by your human visitors while presenting an insurmountable logical barrier to automated systems.

Think of it as a friendly handshake for humans and an unbreachable wall for bots.

## Our Protection Model (Early Access)

During the Early Access phase, Kyvic Aegis uses a time-based protection model. This means a quick neuro-based challenge is periodically shown to visitors to verify they are human. The timing of this check is unique to each individual user, not an event that happens to everyone at once.

We use this direct approach for our initial release for two key reasons:

1. **Maximum Effectiveness Against AI:** Our primary neuro-based challenges are engineered to be a formidable barrier, making it extremely difficult for AI crawlers and scrapers to penetrate your site. However, since no security system can guarantee 100% infallibility, we've built in a powerful fail-safe. The periodic, mandatory check ensures that in the rare event a highly advanced bot manages to slip past our initial defenses, the threat is neutralized at the next checkpoint, preventing any malicious presence from lingering.
2. **Reliability Over Complexity:** While more advanced behavioral analysis is on our roadmap, this time-based system is incredibly robust and predictable. It provides a strong, consistent security baseline for all our early users without the risk of errors that can come from more complex (and sometimes faulty) detection systems.

## Platform Compatibility

Kyvic operates as an edge reverse proxy, sitting between your visitors and your server. To set it up, you'll need the ability to modify your domain's **DNS records** (specifically, the CNAME and TXT records).

Our service is ideal for websites operating on a **single domain** (e.g., `www.example.com`). It also fully supports sites that load resources from **multiple subdomains** (e.g., `assets.example.com`). Please be aware, some sites have strict browser security policies (like CORS or CSP) that control how resources are shared between domains. If you encounter issues with assets not loading, a minor configuration adjustment by your web developer may be needed.

For maximum security, we strongly recommend protecting any critical subdomains with Kyvic as well. This creates a comprehensive shield and prevents **origin IP/hostname exposure**, making it significantly harder for attackers to target your server directly.

| Platform / Website Type                                   | Supported?               | Reason / Notes                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Self-Hosted Websites** (e.g, WordPress, Joomla)         | ‚úÖ **Yes**                | You have full DNS control to point your domain to Kyvic.                                                            |
| **Cloud & VPS Hosting** (e.g, AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner) | ‚úÖ **Yes**                | Ideal use case. You have complete control over your domain and server infrastructure.                               |
| **Managed Blogs** (e.g, Wordpress.com)                    | ‚úÖ **Yes\***              | Our specific setup guide for managed platforms is required.                                                         |
| **Managed Website Builders** (e.g, Squarespace)           | ‚úÖ **Yes\***              | Our specific setup guide for managed platforms is required.                                                         |
| **Managed E-commerce Platforms** (e.g, Shopify)           | ‚úÖ **Yes\***              | Our specific setup guide for managed platforms is required.                                                         |
| **Multi-Subdomain Websites**                              | ‚úÖ **Yes (with config.)** | Works well, but check for restrictive CORS/CSP policies. Protect critical subdomains to prevent origin IP exposure. |
| **Sites with Real-Time Features (WebSockets)**            | ‚ùå **No (Experimental)**  | Support is highly experimental and unstable. Functionality is not guaranteed during the Early Access phase.         |
| **DRM-Protected Video/Media** (e.g., Netflix clones)      | ‚ùå **No**                 | Our proxy can interfere with the secure Digital Rights Management (DRM) path required for protected content.        |

<Note>
  **A Note on Managed Platforms (Shopify, Wix, etc.)**

  With managed platforms, you don‚Äôt have direct control over firewalls like you would with self-hosted servers. That‚Äôs why we use the ‚Äúsecret subdomain‚Äù method as the main way to protect against bypass attempts (see our _Quickstart Guide for Managed Platforms_). Keep in mind that this setup depends on the platform‚Äôs rules, which can change, but Kyvic will work with you to keep everything running smoothly.
