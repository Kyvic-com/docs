title: "Introduction"
description: "Welcome to Kyvic! You're taking a powerful step towards protecting your website from the growing noise of AI crawlers, scrapers, and malicious bots."
---

Modern bots are smart, but they lack true consciousness and the nuanced logic of the human brain. Kyvic Aegis leverages this fundamental gap. Our neuro-based captchas are designed to be effortlessly solved by your human visitors while presenting an insurmountable logical barrier to automated systems. Think of it as a friendly handshake for humans and an unbreachable wall for bots.

## Our Protection Model (Early Access)

During our Early Access phase, Kyvic Aegis uses a time-based protection model. This means a quick neuro-based challenge is periodically shown to visitors to verify they are human. The timing of this check is unique to each individual user, not an event that happens to everyone at once.

We chose this direct approach for our initial release for two key reasons:

1. **Maximum Effectiveness Against AI:** A periodic, mandatory check is the most reliable way to filter out the current generation of AI crawlers and automated scrapers. It ensures no bot can remain on your site undetected for an extended period.
2. **Reliability Over Complexity:** While more advanced behavioral analysis is on our roadmap, this time-based system is incredibly robust and predictable. It provides a strong, consistent security baseline for all our early users without the risk of errors that can come from more complex (and sometimes faulty) detection systems.

## Platform Compatibility

Kyvic is designed to be a universal layer of protection, but its CNAME-based method requires that you have full control over your domain's DNS settings. Please review this table to see if your website is compatible.

| Platform / Website Type                                 | Supported? | Reason / Notes                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Hosted Websites** (WordPress, Joomla, etc.)      | ‚úÖ **Yes**  | You have full DNS control to point your CNAME record to Kyvic.                                            |
| **Cloud Hosting** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)            | ‚úÖ **Yes**  | Perfect for custom applications where you manage the infrastructure.                                      |
| **VPS & Dedicated Servers** (DigitalOcean, Vultr)       | ‚úÖ **Yes**  | Ideal use case. You have complete control over your domain and server.                                    |
| **Developer Platforms** (Vercel, Netlify, Render)       | ‚úÖ **Yes**  | These platforms provide the necessary custom domain controls.                                             |
| **Most API & Mobile App Backends**                      | ‚úÖ **Yes**  | As long as you control the API's custom domain, Kyvic can protect it.                                     |
| **Managed E-commerce Platforms** (Shopify, BigCommerce) | ‚ùå **No**   | These platforms require your domain to point exclusively to their servers, creating a DNS conflict.       |
| **Managed Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace)         | ‚ùå **No**   | These are closed ecosystems that do not allow for this type of external proxying.                         |
| **DRM-Protected Video/Media** (e.g., Netflix clones)    | ‚ùå **No**   | Our proxy interferes with the secure Digital Rights Management (DRM) path required for protected content. |
| **Specialized Course Platforms** (Kajabi, Teachable)    | ‚ùå **No**   | These are managed platforms with similar restrictions to Wix and Shopify.                                 |

<Note>
  **WebSocket Support:**

  Our service includes experimental support for proxying real-time WebSocket connections. While it should be functional for many applications, we are continuing to enhance its reliability. If your site depends heavily on WebSockets, please consider this feature to be in a experimental phase.

  **A Note on Future Support:**

  We are actively exploring partnerships with major managed platforms to offer seamless, one-click integrations in the future. Stay tuned for announcements\!

  **Note on DDoS Protection:**

  Our reverse‚Äëproxy infrastructure provides built‚Äëin, always‚Äëon mitigation for network and transport‚Äëlayer DDoS attacks (L3/4), including large-scale volumetric floods. This foundational protection helps keep your site online under high‚Äëtraffic conditions.

  All traffic, whether benign, anomalous, or malicious, that passes through our network is counted toward your usage plan. For advanced application‚Äëlayer (L7) threats, such as automated HTTP flood attacks or stealthy bot traffic, we recommend a layered security approach. Protect your origin with your own WAF, and be sure to whitelist our IP ranges so that legitimate proxy traffic reaches your origin reliably.
