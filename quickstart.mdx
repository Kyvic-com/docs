<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Add Your Domain to Kyvic" titleSize="h2">
    In your Kyvic Console, add the domain or subdomain you want to protect (e.g., `www.example.com`). Our system will then provide you with the necessary DNS records for the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Configure Your DNS" titleSize="h2">
    This is the most important step. You'll be pointing your domain's traffic to the Kyvic Shield network. Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap) to make these changes.

    <Accordion title="Option A: For Subdomains (Recommended)" defaultOpen="false" icon="globe">
      This is the most common setup, used for domains like `www.example.com`.

      1. Find or add a DNS record for your subdomain (e.g., `www`).
      2. Change its type to `CNAME`.
      3. Set the value (or "target") to: `aegis.kyvic.com`

      <Note>
        **Important:**

        If you're using a service like Cloudflare for your DNS, make sure the proxy status is set to "DNS Only" (grey cloud). This ensures the best performance.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Option B: For Apex/Root Domains" icon="globe-pointer">
      This applies if you want to protect your root domain (e.g., `example.com`).

      - **If your provider supports CNAME Flattening:** Some providers, like Cloudflare, allow you to set a `CNAME` record on your root domain. If so, follow the same steps as Option A for your root (`@`) record.
      - **If your provider does NOT support CNAME Flattening:** This is very common. The industry-standard solution is to set up a simple redirect.
        1. Set up Kyvic for your `www` subdomain as described in **Option A**.
        2. Create a rule in your registrar to **redirect** all traffic from the root domain (`example.com`) to your protected subdomain (`www.example.com`).
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Activate Your SSL Certificate" titleSize="h2">
    To keep your site secure with HTTPS, we need to verify your domain ownership.

    1. In your Kyvic dashboard, you'll see one or two `TXT` records with names like `_acme-challenge`.
    2. Copy these records and add them to your DNS provider. This is a one-time verification step.
    3. Once added, our system will automatically detect them and issue a free SSL certificate for your domain. This can take a up to 48 hours to complete, but is usually done within few minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Use Relative Paths for All Internal Resources" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h2">
    For the best compatibility, ensure all paths to your own resources—including links, images, stylesheets, scripts, and API calls, use **relative paths** starting with a `/`.

    Using absolute paths (with your full domain) can cause assets to break when proxied through our service.

    #### **HTML**

    - ✅ **Good:** `<a href="/about-us">`
    - ❌ **Bad:** `<a href="https://your-site.com/about-us">`

    #### **CSS**

    This applies to `@import` rules and `url()` functions for fonts or background images.

    - ✅ **Good:** `body { background-image: url('/images/background.jpg'); }`
    - ❌ **Bad:** `body { background-image: url('https://your-site.com/images/background.jpg'); }`

    #### **JavaScript & API Calls**

    This is critical for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    - ✅ **Good:** `fetch('/api/data');`
    - ❌ **Bad:** `fetch('https://your-site.com/api/data');`

## Advanced Guides & Edge Cases

Most users won't need this section, but it's here for more complex setups.

### Using Kyvic with an Existing WAF (e.g., AWS WAF)

If you use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on your origin server, you must whitelist our network IPs to prevent your WAF from blocking legitimate traffic.

1. **Get Cloudflare's IPs:** The Kyvic network runs on Cloudflare. Get the official IP list from [cloudflare.com/ips](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).
2. **Create an IP Set:** In your WAF provider's dashboard (like AWS WAF), create an "IP Set" containing all of Cloudflare's IP ranges.
3. **Create an "Allow" Rule:** Add a rule to your WAF that **allows** any traffic coming from the Cloudflare IP Set. This rule should have the highest priority (e.g., run first).

### Protecting Sites with Multiple Subdomains

If your website loads assets (like images or scripts) from different subdomains (e.g., `www.yoursite.com` and `assets.yoursite.com`), you must add **each subdomain** to your Kyvic dashboard and configure a separate `CNAME` record for each one.
