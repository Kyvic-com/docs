<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Add Your Domain to Kyvic" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    In your **Kyvic Console**, go to **Services ‚Üí Aegis ‚Üí Protected Domains**, then add the domain or subdomain you want to protect (for example, `www.example.com`).

    When adding your domain, you'll need to tell Kyvic where your website is hosted. Enter your **hosting's static IP address** (e.g., `123.45.67.89`) or an existing **hostname** (e.g., `my-server-hostname.com`). You can typically find this information in the dashboard of your provider, whether it's a traditional host (like **GoDaddy, Bluehost, or Namecheap**) or a cloud service (like **Hetzner**, **AWS**).

    Our platform will then provide you with the necessary DNS records for the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Configure Your DNS" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    This is the most important step. You'll be pointing your domain's traffic to the Kyvic Aegis network. Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap) to make these changes.

    <Accordion title="Option A: For Subdomains (Recommended)" defaultOpen="false" icon="globe">
      This is the most common setup, used for domains like `www.example.com`.

      1. Find or add a DNS record for your subdomain (e.g., `www`).
      2. Change its type to `CNAME`.
      3. Set the value (or "target") to: `aegis.kyvic.com`

      <Warning>
        If you‚Äôre using a service like Cloudflare for your DNS, ensure that the proxy status is set to ‚ÄúDNS Only‚Äù (grey cloud). This ensures optimal performance for your site.
      </Warning>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Option B: For Apex/Root Domains" icon="globe-pointer">
      This is for your "bare" domain, like `example.com`**(without the "www")**

      - **If your provider supports CNAME Flattening:** Some providers, like Cloudflare, allow you to set a `CNAME` record on your root domain. If so, follow the same steps as \*\*Option A \*\*for your root (`@`) record.
      - **If your provider does NOT support CNAME Flattening:** This is very common. The industry-standard solution is to set up a simple redirect.
        1. Set up Kyvic for your `www` subdomain as described in **Option A**.
        2. Create a rule in your registrar to **redirect** all traffic from the root domain (`example.com`) to your protected subdomain (`www.example.com`).
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Activate Your SSL Certificate" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    To keep your site secure with HTTPS, we need to verify your domain ownership.

    1. In your Kyvic Console, navigate through **Services ‚Üí Aegis ‚Üí Protected Domains ‚Üí DNS Configuration**. On the **DNS Configuration** tab, you should see one or two TXT records with names such as `_acme-challenge`.
    2. Copy these TXT records and add them to your DNS provider. This is a **one-time verification step** to confirm ownership of your domain.
    3. Once you‚Äôve added the records, our system will automatically detect them and issue a **free SSL certificate** for your domain. The certificate is **fully managed**, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about renewals or expiration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Lock Down Your Origin Server Firewall" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h2">
    If you use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or server firewall, you must whitelist our network IPs to prevent your WAF from blocking legitimate traffic and prevent attackers from bypassing Kyvic.

    1. **Get Cloudflare's IPs:** The Kyvic Aegis network runs on Cloudflare. Get the official IP list from [cloudflare.com/ips](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).
    2. **Create an IP Set:** In your WAF provider's dashboard (like AWS WAF), create an "IP Set" containing all of Cloudflare's IP ranges.
    3. **Create an "Allow" Rule:** Add a rule to your WAF that **allows** any traffic coming from the Cloudflare IP Set. This rule should have the highest priority (e.g., run first).
    4. **Block all other traffic** to your web ports (80/443) to ensure your server can only be reached through Kyvic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4 (Recommended): Use Relative Paths for All Internal Resources" stepNumber={5} titleSize="h2">
    For the best compatibility, we **strongly recommend** using **relative paths** for all your resources, including links, images, stylesheets, scripts, and API calls.

    While our proxy is designed to handle absolute paths (those with your full domain), the process isn't perfect. Using them can cause assets to break when proxied through our service. To ensure everything loads correctly, please make sure all paths to your own resources start with a `/`.

    #### **HTML / JSX**

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `<a href="/about-us">`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `<a href="https://your-site.com/about-us">`

    #### **CSS**

    This applies to `@import` rules and `url()` functions for fonts or background images.

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `body { background-image: url('/images/background.jpg'); }`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `body { background-image: url('https://your-site.com/images/background.jpg'); }`

    #### **JavaScript & API Calls**

    This is critical for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `fetch('/api/data');`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `fetch('https://your-site.com/api/data');`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Verifying Your Setup" stepNumber={6} titleSize="h2">
    Once DNS propagation is complete, a **"Protected"** badge will appear next to your domain, showing that your site is now safeguarded against harmful bots and AI scrapers.

    <Info>
      Although the process can take up to 48 hours, it typically completes within a few minutes to a couple of hours.

## Advanced Guides & Edge Cases

Most users won't need this section, but it's here for more complex setups.

### Protecting Sites with Multiple Subdomains

If your website loads assets (like images or scripts) from different subdomains (e.g., `www.yoursite.com` and `assets.yoursite.com`), you must add **each subdomain** to your Kyvic Console and configure a separate `CNAME` record for each one.
