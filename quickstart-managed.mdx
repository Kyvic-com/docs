<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Generate a Secret Subdomain" titleSize="h2">
    To hide your true origin on your managed platform, you first need to create a secret, unguessable subdomain.

    1. **Generate a Random String:** Use a secure tool to generate a random hex string (e.g., from an online UUID4 generator like `uuidgenerator.net`). Example: `a7c3f1b9d4e84f5a8c7b6e2d1f0a9b3c`.
    2. **Form Your Secret Subdomain:** Combine the random string with your domain. Example: `a7c3f1b9d4e84f5a8c7b6e2d1f0a9b3c.example.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Connect Your Platform to the Secret Subdomain" titleSize="h2">
    Log in to your managed platform (e.g., Shopify) and follow their instructions to connect a custom domain. When they ask for DNS settings, use your \*\*secret subdomain \*\*created during Step 1.

    1. In your DNS provider, create a new `CNAME` record.
    2. Set the **Host/Name** to your random string (e.g., `a7c3f1b9d4e84f5a8c7b6e2d1f0a9b3c`).
    3. Set the **Value/Target** to the hostname your platform provides (e.g., `shops.myshopify.com`).
    4. Go back to your platform's dashboard and wait for them to **verify the connection**. This is a crucial step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Add Your Main Domain to Kyvic" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    In your **Kyvic Console**, go to **Services ‚Üí Aegis ‚Üí Protected Domains**, then add your main, public-facing domain (for example, `www.example.com`).

    When adding your domain, you'll need to tell Kyvic where your website is hosted. For the **origin hostname**, enter your **full secret subdomain** from Step 1 (e.g., `a7c3f1b9d4e84f5a8c7b6e2d1f0a9b3c.example.com`).

    Our platform will then provide you with the necessary DNS records for the next steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Point Your Main Domain to Kyvic" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h2">
    Now for the final DNS change, where you make the protection live. You will point your main public domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) to the Kyvic Aegis network.

    1. Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Cloudflare).
    2. Find the DNS record for your `www` subdomain. If one doesn't exist, create it.
    3. Update the record to the following settings:
       - **Type:** `CNAME`
       - **Name:** `www`
       - **Target/Value:** `aegis.kyvic.com`

    <Warning>
      If you‚Äôre using a service like Cloudflare for your DNS, ensure that the proxy status is set to ‚ÄúDNS Only‚Äù (grey cloud). This ensures optimal performance for your site.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Activate Your SSL Certificate" stepNumber={5} titleSize="h2">
    To keep your site secure with HTTPS, we need to verify your domain ownership.

    1. In your Kyvic Console, navigate through **Services ‚Üí Aegis ‚Üí Protected Domains ‚Üí DNS Configuration**. On the **DNS Configuration** tab, you should see one or two TXT records with names such as `_acme-challenge`.
    2. Copy these TXT records and add them to your DNS provider. This is a **one-time verification step** to confirm ownership of your domain.
    3. Once you‚Äôve added the records, our system will automatically detect them and issue a **free SSL certificate** for your domain. The certificate is **fully managed**, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about renewals or expiration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6 (Recommended): Use Relative Paths for All Internal Resources" stepNumber={6} titleSize="h2">
    While most managed platforms handle this automatically, if you're editing your site's theme or adding any custom code (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript), we **strongly recommend** using **relative paths** for all your resources. This includes links, images, stylesheets, scripts, and API calls.

    #### **HTML / JSX**

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `<a href="/about-us">`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `<a href="https://your-site.com/about-us">`

    #### **CSS**

    This applies to `@import` rules and `url()` functions for fonts or background images.

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `body { background-image: url('/images/background.jpg'); }`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `body { background-image: url('https://your-site.com/images/background.jpg'); }`

    #### **JavaScript & API Calls**

    This is critical for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    - ‚úÖ **Good:** `fetch('/api/data');`
    - ‚ùå **Bad:** `fetch('https://your-site.com/api/data');`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 7: Verifying Your Setup" stepNumber={7} titleSize="h2">
    Once DNS propagation is complete, a **"Protected"** badge will appear next to your domain, showing that your site is now safeguarded against harmful bots and AI scrapers.

    <Info>
      Although the process can take up to 48 hours, it typically completes within a few minutes to a couple of hours.
